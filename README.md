## Nameproject

In this project, I wanted to test whether I could utilize CSS to make a graph and create an HTML page without Soma's template. 
Initially, my page was quite terrible, and I couldn't make the "styles" work properly on my own. 

I looked for help with graphics and CSS here:
*[w3shools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_websafe.asp)
*[tutorialsteacher](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js/create-svg-chart-in-d3js)

I also asked ChatGPT for assistance building the webpage. The page is still pretty awful, but at least now I know a bit 
more about how to create SVG and how CSS works.

The baby name statistics were somewhat of a side project for me here. I processed the data in Jupyter Notebook and initially intended to include Finnish name statistics as well, but ultimately I didn't want to spend too much time on it, so I only provided the information in the website's text. The Finnish data can be found in my repository.
